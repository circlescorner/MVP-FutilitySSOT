 7) BUDGET MANAGER (v3.1 CANON)
 ------------------------------
-Budgets are enforced at two levels:
-  1) Hourly cap
-  2) Daily cap
-
-Tracked spend categories:
-  - helper droplet runtime minutes
-  - optional external API token spend
-
-"Worth it" definition (v3.2):
-  - expected_confidence_gain >= threshold OR
-  - risk_reduction >= threshold OR
-  - change_class requires it (e.g., wide refactor)
-
-Hard rule:
-  - The system MUST NOT exceed hourly or daily budgets without explicit user confirmation on the confirm screen.
-
-Budget behavior:
-  - if budget low: prefer questions + local-only chain; avoid escalation
+Replace vague “worth it” with a required scorecard.
+
+For any paid escalation (Lane 1/2/3/4), compute:
+
+WorthItScore = (ExpectedGain * RiskWeight) / EstimatedCost
+
+Where:
+  - ExpectedGain: predicted confidence improvement (e.g., C1->C3 > C1->C2)
+  - RiskWeight: higher for protected zones, many files, core pipeline, auth/CI changes
+  - EstimatedCost: projected dollars for the lane action (include spin-up minimums)
+
+Rules:
+  - If WorthItScore < threshold: do NOT escalate; ask better questions or reduce scope.
+  - Threshold increases as remaining daily budget decreases.
+  - Lane 3 and Lane 4 ALWAYS require explicit user approval regardless of score.
+
+Budget caps (v3.3 canon):
+  - Daily hard cap: $5/day total.
+  - Split into lane-category sub-caps (default):
+    * Local Burst (Lane 1–2): $3.00/day
+    * Runpod (Lane 3):        $1.50/day
+    * External API (Lane 4):  $0.50/day
+
+Hard rules:
+  - The system must not exceed any sub-cap without explicit approval on the confirm screen.
+  - Any single job projected to exceed remaining cap requires explicit approval.
+  - If approval not granted: system must propose a cheaper alternative.
+
+Audit requirement:
+  - The audit log must record estimated vs actual spend per lane.
 
 8) COMPUTE LADDER (v3.1 CANON)
 ------------------------------
-Lane 0: Always-on control plane (minimal; deterministic base load)
-  - UI + orchestration + queue + audit + Git plumbing
-  - No expectation of running a capable LLM locally
-  - Read-only repo inspection + bounded clarifying questions (no paid compute)
-
-Lane 1: Single helper burst (default "real work")
-  - Spin up ONE helper droplet (recommended 2–4GB; choose smallest that meets task needs)
-  - Used for sandbox apply, formatting/lint/tests, and deterministic checks, then destroyed
-
-Lane 2+: Escalation beyond a single helper (NOT default; requires explicit confirmation)
-  - If more than one helper, a larger tier, or an external API call is recommended:
-    - system must present a cost/benefit summary on the confirm screen
-    - user must explicitly approve the extra spend
-  - If approval is not granted: downgrade to a cheaper plan (more questions, smaller helper, reduced scope) or stop at Draft
-
-GO / confirm semantics (v3.2 canon):
-  - The system prepares a Proposed Execution (plan + targets + diff preview + risk + confidence + projected cost).
-  - User sees confirm screen where GO proceeds to execute (create branch, commit, push, open PR).
+Lane 0: ALWAYS-ON CONTROL PLANE (1GB, boring, deterministic)
+  - No expectation of running an intelligent LLM locally.
+  - Responsibilities:
+    * UI (Chat + PATCHGIT)
+    * auth + sessions (PIN)
+    * queue + serialization lock
+    * audit log + budget manager
+    * repo metadata scan / file targeting preflight
+    * generates bounded clarifying questions (NO LLM REQUIRED)
+  - Allowed actions:
+    * read-only repo inspection
+    * prepare candidate plans
+    * NEVER spins paid compute unless “worth-it” gates pass
+
+Lane 1: SINGLE HELPER BURST (default “real work”)
+  - Recommended size: 2–4GB (choose smallest that meets task needs)
+  - Purpose:
+    * sandbox apply (fresh clone / isolated working dir)
+    * formatting / lint / tests (deterministic checks)
+    * Panel Review memos + reducer (architect/security/philosopher/coach)
+    * compile ops -> canonical executable patch artifact (e.g., unified diff)
+  - Outcome target: reach C2 (Apply) or C3 (Ship-ready PR)
+
+Lane 2: STRONGER LOCAL BURST (try harder before GPU/API)
+  - Recommended topology: 2×8GB ephemeral helpers
+  - Trigger when (any true):
+    * Lane 1 still < C2 after one pass
+    * multiple plausible plans exist and choice is risky
+    * apply/check failures need non-trivial repair
+    * protected-zone changes are explicitly requested and require deeper critique
+  - Constraints:
+    * one Lane 2 attempt per job (no loops)
+    * produce reduced single canonical artifact (ExecutionRequest or Blocked package)
+
+Lane 3: RUNPOD GPU BURST (worth-it gated; requires approval)
+  - Purpose:
+    * deep reasoning / long-context synthesis / heavy transforms
+    * run “big local model” inference using GPU resources
+    * resolve complex patch repair cases that Lane 2 cannot fix safely
+  - Hard rule:
+    * Lane 3 MUST NOT run automatically.
+    * Lane 3 requires an explicit “Approve Runpod spend” toggle on the confirm screen.
+  - Trigger gate (ALL must be true):
+    * Lane 1 attempted (unless change_class is trivial DOC_ONLY)
+    * Lane 2 attempted OR explicitly skipped with a written reason
+    * system can name the blockage precisely (specific missing reasoning/tool capability)
+    * system predicts Runpod materially improves confidence OR reduces risk
+    * estimated cost fits remaining budget OR user approves extra spend
+  - Required outputs:
+    * must address Panel Review memos explicitly
+    * must output exactly ONE of:
+      - ExecutionRequest (ready)
+      - NeedsClarification (<=3 multiple-choice questions)
+      - Blocked package (what is missing + why it matters + cheapest unblock)
+
+Lane 4: EXTERNAL MODEL API (last resort; requires approval)
+  - Trigger ONLY when ALL are true:
+    1. Lane 3 was attempted and still blocked OR Lane 3 is unavailable
+    2. system states WHY uncertainty remains (specific missing reasoning)
+    3. system predicts API materially improves the outcome vs Lane 3
+    4. user approves “Approve API spend” on confirm screen
+  - API is used to resolve ambiguity / improve plan, NOT to bypass gates.
+
+GO / confirm semantics:
   - GO publishes only by creating a PR (default). Auto-merge remains later opt-in.
