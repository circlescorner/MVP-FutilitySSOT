FUTILITY'S — DEPRECATION LOG
=============================
Date: 2026-02-04
Reason: Consolidation of scattered ideas into unified specification

This folder contains files that have been superseded, duplicated, or
consolidated into the new unified documentation structure.

Nothing here was "wrong" — these files served their purpose during
the brainstorming and iteration phase. They are preserved for
historical reference only.

===============================================================================
DEPRECATED FILES AND REASONS
===============================================================================

1. MASTER seed.md (depreciated UNPATCHED)
   ───────────────────────────────────────
   REASON: Superseded by docs/MASTER.md (v3.4 evolved into consolidated spec)

   This was the original v3 specification. It was iterated upon through
   patches (v3.1 → v3.2 → v3.3 → v3.4) and the evolved version became
   the canonical spec. Key differences from final:
   - Lane 3 was "External API" (now Lane 3 = Runpod GPU, Lane 4 = API)
   - Missing WorthItScore formula
   - Missing PatchOps hybrid model
   - Owner listed as "Madison" (now "Gondor")

   REPLACED BY: docs/MASTER.md

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. docs/USAGE_AI_PATCH_AUTHOR.md.md (double .md extension)
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   REASON: Exact duplicate of docs/AI_PATCH_AUTHOR.md

   This file was accidentally created with a double .md extension.
   Content is identical to AI_PATCH_AUTHOR.md. No unique ideas lost.

   REPLACED BY: docs/PATCH_MANUAL.md (merged document)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. docs/AI_PATCH_AUTHOR.md
   ────────────────────────
   REASON: Merged into docs/PATCH_MANUAL.md

   This was "Part 2" of the patch authoring instructions (Sections 8-10).
   It has been merged with USAGE_AI_PATCH_AUTHOR.md into a single
   complete document.

   REPLACED BY: docs/PATCH_MANUAL.md

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. docs/USAGE_AI_PATCH_AUTHOR.md
   ──────────────────────────────
   REASON: Merged into docs/PATCH_MANUAL.md

   This was "Part 1" of the patch authoring instructions (Sections 0-7).
   Combined with AI_PATCH_AUTHOR.md for completeness.

   REPLACED BY: docs/PATCH_MANUAL.md

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. docs/Assembled/MASTER.md
   ─────────────────────────
   REASON: Moved to docs/MASTER.md (removed unnecessary subfolder)

   The "Assembled" subfolder was unnecessary nesting. Content preserved
   and enhanced in the new location.

   REPLACED BY: docs/MASTER.md

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. docs/Mission and ethics.md
   ───────────────────────────
   REASON: Consolidated into docs/PRINCIPLES.md

   Philosophy and ethics content was duplicated across multiple files
   (README §2, MASTER §0, this file). All unique content preserved in
   the new consolidated PRINCIPLES.md.

   REPLACED BY: docs/PRINCIPLES.md

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. docs/TRAJECTORY_TO_SSOT.md
   ───────────────────────────
   REASON: Consolidated into docs/ROADMAP.md

   The trajectory document had good content but used a different
   numbering system than README §12. The new ROADMAP.md unifies the
   implementation phases and capability stages into one coherent plan.

   REPLACED BY: docs/ROADMAP.md

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Patches in words/*.md (4 files)
   ─────────────────────────────────
   REASON: Historical patch explanations, no longer needed for active spec

   These documented the evolution from v3.1 to v3.4. The changes have
   been integrated into the canonical spec. Preserved here for audit
   trail purposes only.

   Files:
   - 0001-master-v3.1.patch words.md
   - 0002-master-v3.2.patch Words.md
   - 0003-master-v3.3.patch Wards.md
   - 0004-master-v3.4.patch Words.md

   REPLACED BY: docs/MASTER.md (contains change summary)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. import previous plan/ (entire folder)
   ──────────────────────────────────────
   REASON: Brainstorming session content has been reviewed and folded in

   This folder contained an earlier brainstorming session. Key ideas
   that were extracted and incorporated into the new spec:

   INCORPORATED:
   - Asset Resolver Bot (now in MASTER.md)
   - Question Value Gating scoring system (now in PRINCIPLES.md)
   - "Don't Ask — Infer" rule (now in PRINCIPLES.md)
   - Mechanic voting scale 1-5 (now in MASTER.md)
   - SSOT Auditor role (now in MASTER.md)
   - Dual output tracks (SSOT Explorer + Field Guide) (now in MASTER.md)
   - Budget applies to escalation only, never mechanics (now in MASTER.md)
   - Multi-tier escalation model (now in MASTER.md)

   NOT INCORPORATED (decided against or deferred):
   - Points/credits system for mechanics (likely to cause gaming)
   - Four author personas (simplified to AI curation guidelines)
   - Truth+ tier (too risky for hallucination)
   - Separate proposed.git / book.git repos (simplified to single repo)
   - PostgreSQL + pgvector (deferred, SQLite for MVP)

   REPLACED BY: Content folded into new consolidated docs

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Readme.md (original)
    ─────────────────────
    REASON: Replaced with brief intro version

    The original README was 460 lines and duplicated much of MASTER.md.
    New README is a brief intro (~80 lines) that points to documentation.

    CONTENT PRESERVED IN:
    - docs/MASTER.md (technical spec)
    - docs/PRINCIPLES.md (philosophy)
    - docs/ROADMAP.md (phases)
