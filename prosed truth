A proposed truth is something like:

“As of 2026-02, the most likely model for Pump 14B is Model X (confidence 0.72)”

That confidence is not LLM intuition. It’s computed from:

Number of independent sources

Recency

Role weight (tech vs supervisor)

Evidence attached

Historical accuracy of the contributor

Known contradictions

LLM helps explain the proposal:

“This is believed because 3 independent technicians referenced a replacement after the 2021 fire, and no claims to the contrary were made after 2022.”

Humans decide whether that explanation passes the sniff test.
