 Purpose: "Smart patching" system that turns chat/paste into audited Git PRs.
 Scope: Not truth-finding yet. This is a patch authoring + execution pipeline.

 2) DEPLOYMENT TOPOLOGY (DIGITALOCEAN-LED)
-----------------------------------------
+-----------------------------------------
 Always-on Control Plane (stable, boring, always up):
-  - 1x 1GB droplet
-  - Hosts: website UI, PIN auth, sessions, job queue, orchestration, audit log, Git plumbing
+  - 1x always-on droplet (minimal viable size)
+  - Responsibilities:
+    * host website UI (chat + PATCHGIT)
+    * PIN auth + sessions
+    * orchestration (3-stage chain control)
+    * job queue + serialization lock
+    * audit log + budget manager
+    * Git plumbing (clone/pull/branch/commit/push/PR)
   - Holds: DO API token, GitHub token, budget state, config
-  - No expectation of running a capable LLM locally on 1GB; intelligence is normally offloaded.
-
-Burst Workers (ephemeral, on demand):
-  - Spun up only when required
-  - 2–8GB droplets for "real reasoning", heavier formatting, sandbox apply, and checks
-  - May run multiple workers in parallel (swarm mode in later versions)
-  - Destroyed immediately after job completion
-
-External API (last resort):
-  - Called only if local chain uncertain AND expects material improvement
+  - No expectation of running an intelligent LLM locally on the always-on node.
+
+Segregated Sandbox (default safety mechanism):
+  - Goal: test/apply without risking the control plane or breaking the whole thing
+  - Canon rule: any change that could plausibly break the patching system MUST be executed in a segregated sandbox first.
+  - Sandbox model: isolated fresh clone / working dir; runs git apply + format/checks; only after sandbox success does the system push a branch + open PR.
+
+Helper Worker (single extra, on-demand; ephemeral):
+  - The system may scale up to ONE additional helper droplet for general processing.
+  - Helper constraints:
+    * at most 1 helper at a time (no swarm by default)
+    * size target: 2–4GB (choose smallest that meets task requirements)
+    * helper is ephemeral: created → used → destroyed
+  - Helper is used for:
+    * medium reasoning (bigger model via local inference if available)
+    * formatting/linting/tests
+    * repo-wide operations that exceed safe base-load capacity
+    * sandbox apply if base-load sandbox would be too tight
+
+Escalation beyond single helper (requires confirmation):
+  - If the system believes it needs:
+    * more than 1 helper, OR
+    * a larger helper tier than policy allows, OR
+    * external API calls,
+    THEN it must request explicit user confirmation with a cost/benefit summary.

 7) BUDGET MANAGER (v3.1 CANON)
 ------------------------------
-Budget types tracked daily:
-  - burst worker runtime minutes (local compute)
-  - external API token spend
-
-"Worth it" definition (v3.1):
+Budgets are enforced at two levels:
+  1) Hourly cap
+  2) Daily cap
+
+Tracked spend categories:
+  - helper droplet runtime minutes
+  - optional external API token spend
+
+"Worth it" definition (v3.2):
   - expected_confidence_gain >= threshold OR
   - risk_reduction >= threshold OR
   - change_class requires it (e.g., wide refactor)
 
+Hard rule:
+  - The system MUST NOT exceed hourly or daily budgets without explicit user confirmation on the confirm screen.
+
 Budget behavior:
-  - if budget low: prefer questions + local-only chain; avoid swarm; avoid API
-
-Daily budget cap (v3.1):
-  - $2/day total spend cap across burst minutes + API tokens
+  - if budget low: prefer questions + local-only chain; avoid escalation
 
 8) COMPUTE LADDER (v3.1 CANON)
 ------------------------------
-Lane 0: Always-on control plane (1GB)
+Lane 0: Always-on control plane (minimal; deterministic base load)
   - UI + orchestration + queue + audit + Git plumbing
   - No expectation of running a capable LLM locally
-  - Read-only repo inspection + bounded clarifying questions
-
-Lane 1: Medium single worker (2–8GB)
-  - Spin up for "real reasoning", sandbox apply, formatting, and repo checks, then destroy
-
-Lane 2: Swarm workers (either 4×4GB OR 2×8GB)
-  - If still uncertain, orchestrator chooses:
-    - 4×4GB (more parallel critique/votes) OR
-    - 2×8GB (stronger per-agent capability)
-
-Lane 3: External API (last resort)
-  - Call external model API only if:
-    - local chain remains uncertain AND
-    - it can name the uncertainty AND
-    - it predicts the API call will materially improve confidence AND
-    - daily budget permits
-
-Confirm semantics:
-  - Default: CONFIRM creates a PR only (no auto-merge).
-  - Auto-merge is a later optional feature limited to safe change classes.
+  - Read-only repo inspection + bounded clarifying questions (no paid compute)
+
+Lane 1: Single helper burst (default "real work")
+  - Spin up ONE helper droplet (recommended 2–4GB; choose smallest that meets task needs)
+  - Used for sandbox apply, formatting/lint/tests, and deterministic checks, then destroyed
+
+Lane 2+: Escalation beyond a single helper (NOT default; requires explicit confirmation)
+  - If more than one helper, a larger tier, or an external API call is recommended:
+    - system must present a cost/benefit summary on the confirm screen
+    - user must explicitly approve the extra spend
+  - If approval is not granted: downgrade to a cheaper plan (more questions, smaller helper, reduced scope) or stop at Draft
+
+GO / confirm semantics (v3.2 canon):
+  - The system prepares a Proposed Execution (plan + targets + diff preview + risk + confidence + projected cost).
+  - User sees confirm screen where GO proceeds to execute (create branch, commit, push, open PR).
+  - GO publishes only by creating a PR (default). Auto-merge remains later opt-in.
 
 9) CONFIRM SCREEN (REQUIRED BEFORE PR)
 --------------------------------------
-Show:
+Confirm screen is REQUIRED before creating a PR.
+
+Must show:
   - intent summary (what Conductor believes you meant)
-  - targets list (explicit)
+  - explicit targets list
   - diff preview (collapsed + expandable)
   - confidence level (C0..C3) + reasons
-  - spend summary (droplets used / API used)
+  - projected cost + remaining budget (hourly/daily)
+
+If projected cost exceeds remaining budget OR requires escalation beyond 1 helper OR external API:
+  - must show WHY escalation is needed
+  - what it will cost (estimate)
+  - what confidence gain is expected
+  - an explicit "Approve extra spend" toggle
+  - without approval: downgrade to cheaper plan or stop at Draft
 
 Buttons:
-  - EXECUTE: create PR now
+  - GO: proceed to execute (create branch, commit, push, open PR)
   - REVISE: return to Stage 1 with feedback
   - CANCEL: stop; nothing published

 CHANGE SUMMARY (AUTOGENERATED BY PATCH SERIES)
-- v3.1: Reorganized MASTER into a single coherent structure; clarified that 1GB control plane has no expectation of running a capable LLM; folded in v3.1 compute ladder and $2/day cap.
+- v3.1: Reorganized MASTER into a single coherent structure; clarified no capable LLM is expected on the always-on node; folded in v3.1 compute ladder concepts.
+- v3.2: Added segregated sandbox as default safety mechanism; defined single helper worker as the default paid compute; added hourly+daily budget enforcement and GO semantics with explicit approval for extra spend.
 ===============================================================================
 
 PARTS REMOVED / SUPERSEDED (LOG)
-- Superseded: any implication that the always-on 1GB control plane "runs a local LLM" as a required capability. Control plane is stable/deterministic; intelligence is offloaded.
-===============================================================================

-END MASTER v3.1
+- Superseded: any implication that the always-on node must "run a local LLM". Always-on is stable/deterministic; paid compute happens on helpers.
+- Superseded: any default assumption of swarm/multiple helpers without explicit user confirmation. Beyond one helper requires confirmation (v3.2).
