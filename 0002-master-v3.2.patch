 8) EXECUTION LANES (YOUR NEW ESCALATION LADDER)
 -----------------------------------------------
 
 Lane 0: ALWAYS-ON 1GB CONTROL PLANE (BORING, DETERMINISTIC)
 
   - No expectation of running an intelligent LLM locally on 1GB
   - best for: orchestration, bounded questions, repo targeting preflight, git plumbing
   - limitations: do not attempt “real reasoning” or heavy transforms here
 
 
-Lane 1: MEDIUM BURST (single 2–8GB droplet)
+Lane 1: SINGLE HELPER BURST (DEFAULT “REAL WORK”)
 
   Trigger when:
 
     - patch touches multiple files
 
     - patch includes code formatting/lint
 
     - Stage 2 confidence < C2 but close
 
     - repo needs sandbox apply to confirm
 
   Purpose:
 
-    - stronger local reasoning (bigger model) OR more RAM/CPU for tools
-
-    - run deterministic checks
-
-    - produce C2→C3 confidence
+    - sandbox apply (fresh clone / isolated working dir)
+    - formatting / lint / tests (deterministic checks)
+    - repo-wide operations that exceed safe base-load capacity
 
 
-Lane 2: SWARM BURST (either 2×8GB OR 4×4GB)
+Escalation beyond SINGLE HELPER (requires confirmation):
 
-  Trigger when:
+  If the system believes it needs more than 1 helper OR a larger helper tier than policy allows
+  OR external API calls, it must request explicit user confirmation with a cost/benefit summary.
 
-    - uncertainty remains after Lane 1
-
-    - multiple competing plans exist
-
-    - risk is high (many files, complex edits)
-
-    - need multi-angle critique (planner vs critic vs fit)
-
-  Selection heuristic:
-
-    - compute "parallelism need" vs "per-agent capability need"
-
-    - If tasks are independent critique/votes: prefer 4×4GB (more parallel lanes)
-
-    - If each agent must be stronger (bigger model per agent): prefer 2×8GB

-  Output:
-
-    - reduced single PatchProposal/GateVerdict/ExecutionRequest

-Lane 3: EXTERNAL API (last resort)
+External API (last resort; requires confirmation):
 
   Trigger ONLY when ALL are true:
 
     - local chain remains uncertain (Stage 2 FAIL or < C2)
 
     - chain states WHY uncertainty exists (specific missing reasoning)
 
     - chain predicts API materially improves confidence
 
     - budget allows

 PATCH ENTRY LOG
 
 - Applied: MASTER v3.1 (Compute Ladder alignment inside core sections)
+- Applied: MASTER v3.2 (Sandbox + single helper default + hourly/daily caps + GO semantics)
+
+CHANGE SUMMARY
+
+- v3.2: Added segregated sandbox as default safety mechanism.
+- v3.2: Default compute model shifted to “single helper” burst; escalation beyond that requires explicit confirmation.
+- v3.2: Budget enforcement clarified as hourly + daily caps requiring confirm-screen approval to exceed.
+- v3.2: Confirm primary action renamed/defined as GO (creates PR; no auto-merge).
+
+PARTS REMOVED / SUPERSEDED
+
+- Superseded the prior default “swarm burst” description as a default lane; swarm is no longer default behavior in v3.2.
