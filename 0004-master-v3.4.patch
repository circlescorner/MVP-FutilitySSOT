+      * canonical input to the deterministic executor
+      * MUST be fully validated before execution
+    (2) Human-facing: DiffPreview (unified diff)
+      * shown on the Confirm Screen
+      * produced from sandbox apply whenever non-trivial
+  - LLMs MAY propose PatchOps.
+  - The deterministic system MUST validate PatchOps and generate DiffPreview via sandbox apply.
+  - The executor MUST NOT accept freeform “edit this paragraph” instructions directly.
+
+PatchOps — Deterministic Edit Semantics (v3.4):
+  v1 REQUIRED operations (minimum viable, safe):
+    1. CREATE_FILE(path, content)
+    2. REPLACE_FILE(path, content)
+    3. APPEND_FILE(path, content)
+    4. REPLACE_BLOCK(path, block_id, content)  (marker-bounded replacement)
+
+  v1 NOT ALLOWED by default:
+    - fuzzy “modify” (semantic edits without strict boundaries)
+    - “search and replace” without strict context bounds
+    - arbitrary regex replace
+    - AST-based code transforms
+
+  REPLACE_BLOCK semantics (canon):
+    - Files MAY contain explicit markers defining editable regions:
+      <!-- FUTILITYS:BEGIN <block_id> -->
+      ...existing content...
+      <!-- FUTILITYS:END <block_id> -->
+    - REPLACE_BLOCK replaces ONLY the content between the markers for <block_id>.
+    - If markers are missing, the operation MUST FAIL safely and return a Blocked package

+12) STORAGE MODEL (SQLITE + ARTIFACTS) (v3.4 CANON)
+---------------------------------------------------
+Canon decision:
+  - SQLite is the default job metadata store for v1.
+  - “Artifacts” (patch bundles, logs, diff previews, attachments) are stored as files,
+    referenced by SQLite.
+
+SQLite stores:
+  - job_id, timestamps, user/session id
+  - stage outputs (PatchProposal / GateVerdict / ExecutionRequest)
+  - confidence level (C0..C3)
+  - lane used (0..4) + WorthItScore + budget deltas
+  - repo refs (repo url, base branch, commit hashes)
+  - execution status + error reasons
+  - artifact references (paths or object keys)
+
+Artifacts store (choose per deployment; both supported):
+  Option A — Droplet disk (simplest):
+    - Store artifacts under /var/lib/futilitys/artifacts/<job_id>/
+    - Pros: zero extra services, simplest for MVP
+    - Cons: durability depends on backups/snapshots
+
+  Option B — Object storage (recommended for durable audit history):
+    - Store artifacts in object storage (e.g., DigitalOcean Spaces) and reference object keys
+    - Pros: durable, scalable for long-term audit retention
+    - Cons: small monthly base cost
+
+Recommended MVP default:
+  - SQLite + droplet disk artifacts
+  - Enable object storage when audit retention needs grow
+
+Baseline cost notes (informational):
+  - Always-on control plane + SQLite on droplet + artifacts on droplet disk (or object storage)
+  - Burst compute (Lane 1/2), Runpod (Lane 3), and External API (Lane 4) remain governed by
+    budget caps + WorthItScore + confirm toggles (v3.3).

 CHANGE SUMMARY (AUTOGENERATED BY PATCH SERIES)
 - v3.1: Reorganized MASTER into a single coherent structure; clarified no capable LLM is expected on the always-on node; folded in v3.1 compute ladder concepts.
-- v3.2: Added segregated sandbox as default safety mechanism; defined single helper worker as the default paid compute; added hourly+daily budget enforcement and GO semantics with explicit approval for extra spend.
+- v3.2: Added segregated sandbox as default safety mechanism; defined single helper worker default; added GO semantics with explicit approval for extra spend beyond one helper.
+- v3.3: Updated escalation ladder: Lane 3 = Runpod GPU burst (worth-it gated) and Lane 4 = external API (last resort); replaced vague worth-it with WorthItScore scorecard; replaced earlier budget cap with $5/day cap + lane sub-caps; formalized Panel Review role memos + reducer output contract; added required audit trace items for Lane 3.
+- v3.4: Canonized Hybrid Patch representation (PatchOps JSON + DiffPreview unified diff); locked deterministic edit semantics (no fuzzy modify; marker-bounded REPLACE_BLOCK); standardized PR creation via GitHub CLI (gh); specified SQLite job metadata + artifacts storage model (droplet disk vs object storage); amended confirm screen to display PatchOps summary + DiffPreview + spend and approval toggles.
 ===============================================================================
 
 PARTS REMOVED / SUPERSEDED (LOG)
-- Superseded: any implication that the always-on node must "run a local LLM". Always-on is stable/deterministic; paid compute happens on helpers.
-- Superseded: any default assumption of swarm/multiple helpers without explicit user confirmation. Beyond one helper requires confirmation (v3.2).
+- Superseded: freeform paragraph-edit semantics. Executor accepts only validated PatchOps operations; REPLACE_BLOCK requires explicit markers (v3.4).
+- Superseded: any PR creation path that bypasses deterministic executor control. LLMs never run git or gh directly; executor uses gh CLI as the standard PR mechanism (v3.4).
