 Scope: Not truth-finding yet. This is a patch authoring + execution pipeline.
 Owner: Gondor
 ===============================================================================

+
+
+SEPARATION NOTICE (PLATFORM VS PLAN)
+-----------------------------------
+This MASTER contains two distinct layers that must not be conflated:
+
+TRACK A - PLATFORM (THIS GIT REPO + AUTOMATION CONTRACT)
+  - how patch files are named, uploaded, applied, and turned into PRs
+  - how to keep the patcher pipeline stable and deterministic
+  - what changes require explicit authorization because they risk breaking the platform
+
+TRACK B - SYSTEM PLAN (THE IDEA / ARCHITECTURE)
+  - the evolving design for Futility's as a patch authoring + execution pipeline
+  - the long-term trajectory toward SSOT that will fork off once the platform is stable
+
+Rule:
+  - Changes that affect TRACK A are MAJOR and require explicit authorization before patching.
+  - Changes that affect TRACK B may proceed under normal patch rules (still must remain cohesive).
+
+
+A) TRACK A - PLATFORM OPERATIONS (REPO STABILITY CONTRACT)
+---------------------------------------------------------
+Purpose: Keep the Git-based patcher pipeline working, boring, and reliable.
+
+A1) What counts as "platform" in this repo
+  - patch discovery rules (which files trigger runs)
+  - patch apply semantics (git apply order, fail behavior)
+  - PR creation behavior (branch naming, tokens, permissions)
+  - anything under .github/workflows/ or the patch-apply scripts that Actions runs
+
+A2) Authoritative change input
+  - Platform changes and plan changes are submitted as unified-diff patches.
+  - Plan evolution should target docs/MASTER.md only.
+  - Platform changes should be rare and narrowly scoped.
+
+A3) Patch naming + ordering
+  - Patches are applied sequentially by numeric prefix: 0001, 0002, 0003, ...
+  - One change intention per patch (avoid mega-patches).
+  - If a patch fails to apply, do NOT hack the repo by manual edits; fix the patch and re-run.
+
+A4) Review and merge contract
+  - Automation opens a PR. A human reviews and merges.
+  - No direct push edits to docs/MASTER.md for canon changes (PR is the gate).
+  - If a PR diff is larger than expected or touches unexpected content, reject and re-scope.
+
+A5) Major authorization gate (platform safety)
+  - Any patch that changes .github/workflows/, scripts/, patch discovery rules, patch apply semantics,
+    or PR automation behavior is a MAJOR platform change.
+  - For MAJOR platform changes, the patch author (AI or human) MUST request explicit authorization
+    (YES/NO) before producing the patch.
+
+A6) Planned fork notice (future split)
+  - Track A (platform) is intended to stabilize and continue as a reliable patch compiler.
+  - After stability criteria are met, SSOT-seeking work will fork off as a separate track built on
+    this platform.
+  - Until that fork, do not let SSOT ambitions rewrite platform stability rules.
+
+
+B) TRACK B - SYSTEM PLAN (BELOW)
+--------------------------------
+Everything below this point is the system plan. It may evolve as the idea evolves, but must not break TRACK A.

 CHANGE SUMMARY (AUTOGENERATED BY PATCH SERIES)
+- v3.4: Separated TRACK A (platform ops / repo stability contract) from TRACK B (system plan) to keep the repo automation stable while the plan evolves.
 - v3.1: Reorganized MASTER into a single coherent structure; clarified no capable LLM is expected on the always-on node; folded in v3.1 compute ladder concepts.
 - v3.2: Added segregated sandbox as default safety mechanism; defined single helper worker default; added GO semantics with explicit approval for extra spend beyond one helper.
 - v3.3: Updated escalation ladder: Lane 3 = Runpod GPU burst (worth-it gated) and Lane 4 = external API (last resort); replaced vague worth-it with WorthItScore scorecard; replaced earlier budget cap with $5/day cap + lane sub-caps; formalized Panel Review role memos + reducer output contract; added required audit trace items for Lane 3.
